**[Tompang the World: Bringing a Concept to Life][0]**

What i want, from wherever i want, when i want it.

The advent of Globalisation, the Internet, and then Ecommerce made the whole world smaller. Suddenly, there was a proliferation of products made available to anyone anywhere. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/720248a1-aad8-4f5f-827c-ea498741ec72.jpg)

There was one big question in this. How much were you willing to pay for what you wanted? 

If products made it to your shores, would it be priced the same as before? Sadly, the answer would be a straight No. The reason? Well honestly, too many to even start discussing here. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/525a048a-2c97-4ca9-93e3-5ac0875162aa.jpg)

If they didn't, you might still be able to find them, but how much would shipping cost you? For some items, shipping kills. Personally, I've come across situations where shipping cost several times the cost of the actual items. The worst situation is when they won't even ship it to you!

**Tompang (verb)**

Pronounced 'tome-pang'.

Derived from the Malay language meaning to ride on or request a favour.

**Example: **You're going to the post office? Can I tompang some letters to be mailed?

Tompang has been a part of my life from an early age. As a kid that studied overseas from a not-quite-so tender age of 13, living abroad and having the ability to come home at least twice a year meant access to many things which just weren't easily available in Singapore at that time. Whether it be Crisps from the UK,or the latest pair of Jeans from the US, or the latest DVD release of our favourite TV series.

As I matured, Tompang remained, the thing that changed? What friends, family, and now colleagues wanted. Lesser were the small and simple things in life, now they were more specialised and costly products.

Occasionally, we come across these fickle minded people, who ask for things, but when the time came, backed out or denied asking. This would put a damper on things, but by hook or by crook, I made it work for me. (And those people then got written off the list)

Today, we created "Tompang The World", which is a formalisation of the process by which we used to arrange these order,  whether it was by phone, by SMS, or any other means.
